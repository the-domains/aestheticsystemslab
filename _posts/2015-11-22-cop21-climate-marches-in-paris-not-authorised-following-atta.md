description: "Major marches which had been planned to coincide with the COP21 international climate talks in Paris will not be authorised for security reasons, the French government has said. Environmental activists - who had expected attract hundreds of thousands people on 29 November and 12 December - said that they accepted Wednesday's decision with regret, but were now considering \"new and imaginative\" ways of making their voices heard."
