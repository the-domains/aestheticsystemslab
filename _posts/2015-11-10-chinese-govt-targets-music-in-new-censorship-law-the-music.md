description: "Google shut down its Chinese music service in 2012 as the company reportedly refused to compete with the market's oversaturation and high regulatory requirements. The impeding censorship rules complicate and add additional barriers to entry, as companies wishing to supply music services to China would undergo mountainous amounts of content review in an effort to remove content which falls in line with China's definition of 'harmful' content."
